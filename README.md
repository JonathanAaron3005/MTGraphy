# MTGraphy
Human and Computer Interaction final project

This project is the final project of the Human and Computer Interaction course in semester 2 which is done in groups consisting of two people. MTGraphy is an international photography company 
that has been around for a long time and wants to update its website appearance. In accordance with the course, this project only emphasizes design (User Interface) and does not require a server. 
When working on this project, we did a lot of research related to the principles of human and computer interaction such as creating an attractive display but still striving for consistency. In accordance 
with the provisions of the project, we create features and pages as listed. 

We started by creating a prototype design using Figma and then applying it to code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The 
use of Bootstrap is prohibited in this project. In this project, the main concepts we use are DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation and CSS box positioning concept, especially flexbox to control 
the position of HTML elements. Apart from that, we also use the addEventListener() method a lot to handle events on objects. 

We also apply client-side validation for filling out forms when users 
want to subscribe to ensure that all data has been filled in validly. At the time of creating this project, we were still not very familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so the biggest challenge was to 
create a responsive design particularly for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Therefore, creating responsive designs is a topic that we researched extensively during the creation of the project
